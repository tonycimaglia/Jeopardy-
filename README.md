# Jeopardy-
Project 1

Description:

I created a Jeopardy Game where a user will answer trivia questions. The user clicks on dollar amounts in a grid of 30 boxes. Every time they get an answer right, they are awarded the dollar amount for that question and it is displayed in a scoreboard. If they miss, the dollar amount is subtracted from the score. The game ends after the user has answered all of the questions.

Version 2:

In version two I would like to:

-Incude instructions for users who aren't familiar with Jeopardy!
-Have two players be able to compete against each other. 
-Add a final jeopardy and daily double feature.
-Create a new game button.
-Incorporate Sounds.
-Incorporate an API that will generate random questions, categories, and answers so the user can keep playing the game without it being repetitve.
