# Jeopardy-
Project 1

Description:

I'm creating a Jeopardy Game where multiple users will compete against each other to answer trivia questions. Every time one of them gets an answer right, they are awarded the points for that question. If they miss, they will lose the points. The user who has the most points after all the questions have been attempted wins the game.
